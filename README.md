# Software Engineer - Product Engineering & Applied AI

I design, build, and scale software that turns complex ideas into clear, reliable products. I keep a research backlog of new technologies, projects, and toolsâ€”and adopt them when they improve developer velocity or user experience.

## What I Do
- Ship production systems from architecture to delivery with measurable outcomes
- Apply AI/ML where it adds real value (recommendations, assistants, automation)
- Translate complex requirements into intuitive, performant interfaces
- Prioritize reliability, accessibility, and maintainability

## Interests
- AI-enhanced applications and intelligent APIs
- Developer experience, performance budgets, and observability
- Rapid evaluation of frameworks, tooling, and platform capabilities

## Toolchain
- **Core:** TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Expo, MongoDB
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow.js, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
- **Plus:** testing, CI/CD, cloud deployment, monitoring

## Principles
- Evidence over hype: choose tools based on impact, not trend
- Tight feedback loops: instrumentation first, iterate with data
- Clarity by default: readable code, explicit contracts, strong ergonomics
